        <p class="flex font-semibold ">What are the rules for each restriction.</p>
        <p class="flex ">The Challenge Runs are meant to provide you a fun challenge to these games. The rules are not very specific for this reason, some people might cheat in the weapon they have to use with the cheat ending, while others will rush to get that weapon and use nothing else. It is for you to decide how to stick to these rules. For the leaderboards, we'll be making separate strict rules when it launches.</p>
